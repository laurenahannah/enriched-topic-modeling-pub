	INPUTS:
	- <RESULTS_DIR>: directory containing subfolders for each company and a .csv of movement labels associated with each date/ticker; subfolders contain MALLET output as generated by the functions in omnimixture
	- <LABEL_FILE>: absolute path for filename for labels
 
	OUTPUTS:
	- <RESULTS_DIR>/df_R2.csv: stores generalized and adjusted R2 values for each company
	- <RESULTS_DIR>/rf_results.csv: stores random forest results for each company


STEPS to run prediction in order to get df_R2.csv and rf_results.csv:

1) Run prediction.sh with the following options

```sh
$  sh prediction.sh <RESULTS_DIR>
```


	- <RESULTS_DIR>: absolute path that contains the omnimixture .csv files for each company

Example:

	sh prediction.sh results results/label_SP500_01012006_11302013.csv


=========================================================
Details:

(1) Get R2 values for topic representations of each document—is there correlation between LDA representation and omnigraph representation?

(1a) store_R2.R
	Traverses all ticker symbols in folder to get R2 values
	Calls:
		topic_generalized_R2.R
	
	Runs as a script with inputs hard coded; can be changed into a function
	Inputs:
		file_path = where all files are stored, like ”../results/Reuters/gics50/"
	Outputs:
		df_R2.csv : 	csv file with R2 values per ticker symbol

(1b) topic_generalized_R2.R
	Function that loads in two topic matrices and returns generalized R^2 and average adjusted R^2 to measure correlation
	
	Inputs:
		- topic_mat1:	matrix with n rows (documents), n_topic columns (topics)
		- topic_mat2:	same dimension as topic_mat2, but different fit
	Outputs:
		- generalized_R2:	generalized R^2 value
		- adjusted_R2:		average adjusted R^2


(2) rf_omnimixture.R
	Use random forests on subsets of features; training is earlier part of data, testing is later
	Runs as a script with inputs hard coded; can be changed into a function

	Inputs:
		- path_results_high_level: 	store path to mallet results for a given gics sector, like "results/"
		- label_path	:	location of movement labels, e.g. ”results/label_SP500_01012006_11302013.csv"
		- break_date	:	date to break into testing/training sets, like as.Date("2012-01-01")	

	Outputs:
		- rf_results.csv	:	number of incorrect predictions per data set/method
